            <div class="site-info">
              <p>Well, coming from a non-IT background it took me slightly longer time to get into the concepts of HTML and CSS but with continuous practice and the help and support provided by our Module Leader Ankit Thapa sir made it easier for making by concepts of Web-Development strong. I got to face lot of challenges with html and it took time for me learn about the div concepts and form concept in this HTML. I got attracted by the features of CSS which beautifies the page but I found it quite difficult and annoying while making the site responsive while doing thing project. The result it turned out when I used CSS in practice phase made me interested in learning further concepts like annoying. I got to learnt about debugging by commenting the specific line where I encountered an error but sometimes It emerged out to be the difficult thing for me and took a lot of time to get the problem solved but after the positive result appeared it raised my happiness. I got to learn about the different concepts like card forms and animation for the page as well as the grid for the projects page. Designing was tough having limited knowledge about this particular thing at the initial phases it became quite tough. It tuned out to be irritating when one CSS property could destroy every component of the site and made it look poor. It was a challenging thing when you have to add menu bar or hamburger icon but with this, I got to know about the checkbox concept for adding menu or hamburger. 
                I added the background image which is pleasing to eyes and talking about the colour combination firstly I added the colours and fonts and did some slight modifications going into the console of the web browser to determine the suitable colour combination for the webpage.</p>
